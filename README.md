Based on the SIEP theory, I optimized the application of linear obstacles, added the judgment of the corner of the wall, and optimized the relevant parameters, so that the SIEP can work to reach the destination.

The application scenarios of experiment 2 and experiment 3 are complex terrain, and the experiment 4 is to test the performance of the SIEP algorithm in a narrow channel.

SIEP concept was inspired by Prof.ChaoYu Chen 10.1109/tits.2017.2761865
